##Welcome to Bitfarm - An Automatic Liquidity Acquisition Yield Farm & AMM on Binance Smart Chain.

###Introduction

Bitfarm is automatic liquidity acquisition yield farm and AMM decentralized exchange running on Binance Smart Chain with lots of unique and creative features that let you earn and win.

We fully support CAKE-LP v2 staking.

###Main Features

##Automatic Liquidity

Each transfer of BFE must pay a 5% transfer tax. The 4% transfer tax gets added to the liquidity pool through the contract automatically to raise the price floor continuously. And the liquidity will be locked and inaccessible.

​​

##Automated Burning

As we have mentioned above, each transfer of RUSH must pay a 5% transfer tax. The 4% transfer tax will be allocated to automatic liquidity acquisition. And the rest 1% transfer tax will be burned immediately. The whole process is automatic.

​

##Harvest Lockup

Harvest lockup is a unique rewards lockup mechanism used to limit the frequency of harvest. It is designed to prevent farming arbitrage bots from constantly harvesting and dumping.

​

##Deposit Fee Redistribution

A 4% deposit fee will be charged when users enter staking on Bitfarm, we plan to use the deposit fee to add more liquidity buy back pool. This provide instead of the removed liquidity of BFE buyback pool.


##BuyBack

Every time this function is called 2% of liquidity is removed and the liquidity is then split into BNB and BFE. BNB market buys BFE. The rest ~99% of the BFE is then burned ~ 1% of BFE sent to caller of the function to incentivize user spending gas.

​

##Referral Program

An on-chain referral program has been implemented to incentivize users to invite friends to join the farming. Inviters can earn 1% of his/her friends' earnings forever.

​

##No Migrator Code

The migrator code in the MasterChef contract has been removed.



##Timelock

Timelock has been added at launch.

##Trading Incentive

We plan to add a trading incentive mechanism to our own AMM dex. Users can earn tokens by trading on Bitfarm. But different from traditional trading mining, the rewards on Bitfarm for trading can be different tokens. Other projects can provide their own tokens as rewards for specified trading pairs. More details about it will be published later.
